# JS Invaders

### A simple game focused on training newer developers for quick acquisition of programming logic outcomes.

_Built with the awesome [Kontra JS](https://straker.github.io/kontra/) game engine and as much ES6 as I can fit into a program._

- A Galaga/Space Invaders rip off, and it’ll basically just be a slightly-more-interesting version of flash cards by the time I’m done with it. At least, for version 1.0.<br>
- “Enemies” with little “questions” on them will appear, and you have to change your ship’s guns to fire a “truthy” (green) or “falsy” (red) bullet at it to gain points (or something)<br>
(“1” !== 1)<br>
(“1" == 1)<br>
(1 == 1)<br>
(!!(10000))<br>
((Math.abs(-3) < 2) || (0.3+0.2 === 0.1))<br>
